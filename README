    --- 1. Information ----------------------------

    This Notify CD Player source code release is provided AS IS and 
    it compiled just fine using Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0 when it was 
    released. The code also, usually, passes Bounds Checker without
    too much complaints.

    The code might not be the nicest you've seen, but it hould be 
    considered that this project started as a small hack to provide 
    a fast way to pause/restart the disc when someone with a tie
    entered the office... and I sure didn't plan on releasing the code!

    If you CHANGE anything or ADD anything, please send me a copy
    of the changes and I might add them to the general distribution.

    Also, please contact me before you make enhancements that you think 
    should be incorporated in the general release for a discussion 
    about it.

    Latest source code should be available at 
    http://www.artech.se/~mlt/software/src/

    Regards,
    Mats

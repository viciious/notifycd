//                  independent of the underlying protocol. This was also
//                  done to support the query sites command without having to
//                  write the same code again.
// 980111 Mats		Added query sites
// 980112 Mats      Found a bug with the disc id that was in uppercase

// 980114 Mats      Don't delete entry when category is changed if we use
//                  the INI file as local database
// 980114 Mats      Make query local and store local (INI) default if no
//                  old options are found.
// 980115 Mats      Found and fixed a parsing bug of CDDB entries in Windows
//                  format that caused a crash

//                  arguments to be passed along
// 980219 Mats      Query as a thread which makes the player start playing 
//                  while it does a remote query. Possible due to the thread
//                  safe stuff above
// 980219 Mats      Fixed the track length bug where the last track didn't get
//                  the correct length.
// 980221 Mats      Only automatic remote queries are done as a separate 
//                  thread.

//                  instead of "do you want to download it?"
// 980222 Mats      Changed VERSION_PATH to a separate file for beta versions.

// 980412 Mats		Made the category choose dialog multiselect and better

//                  user went into the Options dialog/Controls tab and choose
//                  cancel.
// 980420 Mats      Fixed the bug that caused CD Remaining to show negative
//                  times...

//                  discs number of tracks when reading the tracks from the

// 980421 Mats      Fixed the bug where track title displayed was relative to
//                  the CD and not to the playlist.

//                  the programmed list by selecting it again.

//					servers seem to want that.
// 980603 Mats		If the Skip dialog is open while the CD stops it will

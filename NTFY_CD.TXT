 --- 3. How to install/uninstall --------------------------------------------

    Run the NTFY_CD.INF install file by right-clicking the icon in the 
    Explorer and choose "Install".

    Use the control panel "Add/Remove Programs" applet to completely 
    uninstall Notify CD Player.

 --- 4. How to use ----------------------------------------------------------

    - Fast control of misc functions
    --------------------------------

        For faster operation a number of functions can be configurably 
        controlled by clicking a number of times on the icon, click-dragging
        on the icon or by pressing a configurable hotkey.

        All these operations can be configured in the Controls tab

        The default settings are:

        Play/Next       1 click
        Pause/Resume    2 clicks
        Prev            3 clicks
        Stop            4 clicks

        So to start playing Your CD, if it's not already playing due to 
        Windows autoplay, You can click once on the icon.

        Note how the icon change from the "stop" icon to the "play" icon!

        To pause, click two times on the icon. The icon changes to a "pause"
        icon.

        To resume click one or two times (in this case Play/Next is the same
        as resume). The CD starts to play again.

        Change to the next track by clicking one time on the icon.

        Stop the CD by clicking four times. The icon changes back to the 
        "stop" icon.


    - The right-click context menu
    ------------------------------

        The right-click context menu contains everything Notify CD Player can 
        do besides the fast left-click functions.

        The common Play/Stop/Next/Prev etc are all there, so are a Tracks 
        menu, open and close options, play mode etc

        Play mode
        ---------
        - Repeat. Repeat the current playlist.
        - Random. Random play the playlist.
        - Play whole which causes the player to bypass any playlist You might 
          have set up in the CD Info/Program dialog, but it doesn't remove 
          the playlist from the configuration for this CD.
        - Repeat Track causes the current track to be repeated.

        Tracks
        ------
        Choose the Tracks submenu and You'll see the names of the tracks (if 
        You have any DB with data in it) or the default "Track 1" names along 
        with track lengths. You can choose which track to play by selecting 
        it in the tracks menu. 
        The tracks menu can also be configured to be a separate column in the 
        context menu and then the Tracks submenu will dissapear. 
        The tracks menu can also be divided into submenys if the CD You 
        currently have in the player has more than 25 tracks. 
        This function can be disabled in the options dialog if You have a 
        high screen resolution and therefore doesn't need to break up the 
        tracks.
        
        Other
        -----
        The Other submenu contains less used commands. 
        
        The functions found here are:
        
        - Set absolute position can be used to move to a specified track and 
          a specified position on that track. For example if there is 
          some interesting sound at a specific position on a certain track 
          this can be used to find it again.
        - Skip lets You cue inside the current track.

        - CD Database Editor brings up the database editor described below.

        - Add to queue. Add the current CD to the retrieval queue.
        - Get queued items. Retrieves CD information from the CDDB database
          for the discs that are queued for retrieval.
        - Remove queued items. Empty the retrieval queue.


    - CD Info/Program
    -----------------
        
        The CD Info/Program dialog plays a central role in Notify CD Player
        since it's the place where You enter information about the CD 
        playing, like Artist, tracks etc. This is also where You set up
        a playlist where You can program tracks in a certain order or play
        the same track many times etc.

        - Playlist tab: This is where You enter the name of the CD and it's 
            tracks. This is also the place where You program the CD 

        - More CD info tab: This tab handles additional information about 
            the CD.

        - More track info tab: This tab handles additional information about 
            the track.
        
        Internet DB menu:
        - Get from Internet. This option queries the remote server for info 
          about the current CD.
        - Send to Internet. This option send this CD information to the 
          central CDDB repository by e-mail.
        - Add to queue. Adds the current CD to the retrieval queue.
          

          NOTE: The mail is sent using MIME and the text is encoded using 
          Quoted-Printable. If your mailserver has a problem with this you
          can disable it by setting No_MIME in the [CDDB] section of 
          CDPLAYER.INI to 1.

        
    - Options
    ---------

        The options dialog is where You configure all the different functions
        found in the player. It consist of a number of tabs described below.

        General tab
        ===========

            This is where You configure the general (whoha!) options!

            Misc options
            ------------
            - Stop CD on exit. Causes Notify CD Player to stop playing 
              before exiting.
            - Stop CD on start. Causes Notify CD Player to stop playing 
              when starting.
            - Exit on CD remove. Cause Notify CD Player to exit when the 
              CD is removed. This can be pretty nice when used together 
              with Windows autoplay since the Autoplay function will start 
              Notify CD Player again when a CD is inserted.
            - Prev always prev track. By default Notify CD Player restarts 
              the current track if prev is choosen and more than five 
              seconds have been played of the track instead of selecting 
              the prev track. This option causes the player to always 
              choose the prev track and never restart the track when 
              prev is choosen.
            - Remember status. Causes the player to remember certain 
              status flags such as repeat and random between runs.
            - No insert notification. Can be used on older CD devices 
              or drivers that doesn't send notification messages when a 
              CD is inserted/removed. This option is also needed if You 
              have disabled the insert notification in Windows 95.
            - Tracks menu as column. Causes the tracks menu to dissapear 
              and appear as a second column in the context menu. 
              Check it out! It's pretty neat!
            - No bitmap in menu. Turns of the bitmap shown in the context 
              menu.
            - No menu break. By default Notify CD Player breaks up the 
              tracks menu into submenus when a CD with more than 25 
              tracks is used. This option prevents this.
            - Artist/Title in menu. Show artist and title at the top in the
              popup menu.
            - Automatically check for new version. Makes Notify automatically 
              check for a new version every time Notify is started and every
              time a new disc is entered. This is done in the background and
              doesn't influence the regular operation.

            Register Notify CD Player as default player
            -------------------------------------------
            This button registers Notify as the default CD Player on the 
            system.

            Default CD Device
            -----------------
            Specifies which CD device to use by default when starting up and no    
            other device is specified on the command line. Only used by users 
            with multiple CD devices.

            Poll status every
            -----------------
            Is used when no CD is in the drive or when the full status check
            option is used. A value of 1 is ok.

            External program to run when a new disc is inserted
            ---------------------------------------------------
            Enter the path to an program You want to run when a new CD is 
            inserted. Artist and CD title will be sent as argument 1 and 2 
            to the program. The MCI and CDDB ids are sent as argument 3 
            and 4.
            
            This can be used to update the .plan file to
            include the name of the CD You are currently listening to or
            whatever.
            

        Controls tab
        ============

            This is where You configure the controls for different CD 
            playing functions.

            The left column indicates the number of clicks or click-drag 
            operations available.

            The middle column is an optional hotkey to use the the specified
            action.

            The right column is where You select the function you want to
            be controlled.

        Tooltip/Caption tab
        ===================

            Caption
            -------
            - Show info on active caption. This option displays the same 
              information as the tooltip in the caption (title bar) of the
              active window.
            - Font. By selecting this option You can choose the font to use
              when displaying info in the caption.
        
            This is where You configure what is to be shown in the tooltip
            and the active caption.

            
            Tooltip and Caption buttons
            ===========================
            
            Press one of them to select information regarding that type


            Format
            ------
            This is where you enter the string to be parsed and displayed.
            Format specifiers are translated to the actual CD information
            run-time. For example: "%0 - %1" will show 
            "New Artist - New Title" if no information is available.

            Example
            -------
            Shows how the format string will look like on the tooltip/caption
            using the current CD information.
            
            Format specifiers
            -----------------
            The available information that can be used in the format string.
            %% gives a single %.


        Database tab
        ============

            This is where You configure different database options Notify
            can use.

            What type of local database to use
            ----------------------------------

            - CDPLAYER.INI database. This will use the regular CDPLAYER.INI
              as local database. Note that INI files are limited to 64K 
              under Windows 95.
            - CDDB local database. This will enable the use of the CDDB 
              local database format. This format will create a number of
              directories in the path specified in the CDDB Local tab and
              store CD entries in one of the two formats available. Use
              this if Your database exceeds the Windows 95 limit on the 
              INI file.

            What to automatically query when a new CD is inserted
            -----------------------------------------------------

            - Local database. This will query the local database for CD
              information each time a CD is inserted.
            - Remote CDDB database server. This will query the remote 
              CDDB server configured in the CDDB Remote tab if the CD
              was not found in the local database.

            Queue options
            -------------

            - Add CD to queue if information could not be retrieved. 
              This will add the CD to the retrieval queue if the 
              information could not be retrieved at the moment. 
              I.e. if the server reports some error. If the query
              goes through, but no disc information is available, the
              CD will *NOT* be queued.
            - Automatically get queued CD info when retrieving other CDs
              This option will make Notify to try to get the queued items
              after an automatic remote query has succeeded.

            What to store in local database
            -------------------------------

            - Store changes in local database. This will store 
              modifications to the CD entry in the local database.
            - Store remote query result. This will directly store a 
              found CD entry in the local database after querying the
              remote CDDB server.
        

        CDDB Local
        ==========

            This is where You configure the local CDDB database (if used)

            The path where the local CDDB database will be stored
            -----------------------------------------------------

            This is the path where the CDDB database will be stored. The 
            player will create directories in this path as they are needed
            and store files in the format specified below.

            Type of local CDDB database
            ---------------------------

            This specifies the type of local CDDB database to use. The 
            Unix format is faster but wastes much space on FAT partitions.
            The Windows format is not as fast but wastes less space since 
            it will store multiple CD entries in each file.


        CDDB Remote
        ===========
        
            This is where You configure the remote CDDB server used by
            the remote query function.

            Protocol
            --------

            - HTTP. Uses standard port 80 HTTP protocol to query for CD
              information.
            - CDDB. Uses the CDDB server protocol on port 888 to query for
              CD information. May not work on many firewalls.
            - Port is only used by the CDDB protocol and should, for the 
              moment, always be set to 888.

            
            Server
            ------

            This specifies the fully qualified hostname of the server to 
            query for CD information.

            Query this server for site list
            -------------------------------
            Query the selected/configured server for a list of servers

            For an updated list of servers, check out
            http://www.cddb.com/sites.html

            HTTP Path
            ---------

            This is the path to the CGI script that runs the remote query. 
            Should almost always be /~cddb/cddb.cgi. This is only used
            for HTTP queries.

            Proxy
            -----

            This is where You configure Your proxy server if needed. 
            There is no SOCKS support.

            - Use proxy. Check this button to enable the use of a proxy 
              server.

            - Proxy server. Enter the fully qualified hostname of the 
              proxy server.

            - Proxy port. The port that the proxy server listens to 
              HTTP requests on.

            - Use Proxy Authentication. Check this button to enable support
              for proxy servers that require authentication.

            - User. Fill in your proxy user name here.

            - Ask for password. Check this if you don't like the fact about
              storing your password in the CDPLAYER.INI file described below.

            - Password. Fill in your proxy password here. 

                Be aware that the password "encryption" used to store the 
                password in the INI file isn't exactly rocket science so 
                you store it there on your own risk!

                Besides the source code used to store the password is free 
                and the mangling of it is reversable so anyone with access
                to your CDPLAYER.INI and the source code could easily 
                steal it!

            NOTE: Proxy authentication uses the 
            "Proxy-Authorization: Basic <user>:<password>" standard where
            <user> and <password> are sent base64 encoded. If your proxy
            doesn't use this standard, proxy authentication will not work.

            Timeout for remote operations
            -----------------------------

            This specifies the general timeout (in seconds) for all 
            the remote operations.


        Dial-up
        =======
        
            This tab is only availble if Dial-up-networking is installed. 

            This is where you configure if and how Notify should use 
            Dial-up-networking.

            - Use Dial-up-networking for remote connections. Tells Notify
              that you want to use Dial-up-networking for remote operations.

            Dial-up-networking settings
            ---------------------------

            This is where you configure how Notify should use 
            Dial-up-networking.

            - Automatically open this connection when doing a remote query. 
              Tells Notify to automatically open this connection, if it's
              not already open, when it should do a remote connection. 

            - If another connection is already open, use it instead. If 
              another Dial-up connection is connected instead of the 
              selected. Use that one instead.

            - Connection. Select the connection you would like to use.

            - User name. User name for the connection.

            - Password. Password for the connection.

            - Close Dial-up connection when finished. Close the connection
              when the remote operation is finished.

            - Only perform remote operations if a connection is already open.
              This option tells Notify that it should only attempt to do
              a remote operation if a Dial-up connection is already available.
    

        e-mail tab
        ==========

 --- 5. Command-line options ------------------------------------------------

    Notify CD Player supports a number of command-line options which 
    can be used when starting up. If the program is invoked as a second
    instance it will send the commands to the already active instance. 
    Using the command-line options makes it possible to make keyboard
    shortcuts that pause or selects the next track etc.

    -PLAY [track path] 
        Starts playing the disc from the start or from the track number
        specified by track path. Track path must include a drive specifier.
        If the disc is paused it will continue.
        Example: "NTFY_CD -PLAY Z:\TRACK03.CDA" will play track 3 on drive Z

    -PAUSE
        Toggles pause mode. If the disc is playing it will be paused, 
        otherwise it will continue to play. If this is the first instance
        it will start the player in pause mode.

    -STOP
        Stops the playing

    -NEXT
        Selects the next track in the playlist or restarts from the first 
        track if the last one is playing.

    -PREV
        Selects the previous track in the playlist or restarts from the 
        last track if the first one is playing.

    -RANDOM
        Toggles random mode

    -REPEAT
        Toggles repeat mode

    -OPEN
        Open the CD-ROM drive

    -CLOSE
        Close the CD-ROM drive

    -EXITIFNODISC
        Exit the first instance upon startup if no disc is in the CD-ROM drive

    Some of them can be used together, You could probably figure out which 
    ones. Some of them work a little different when controlling an already
    running instance than they do when controlling the startup of the first
    instance.

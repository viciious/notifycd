* Wrap CD titles in the menu, or truncate them.  You might have a "wrap at ..." or 
  "truncate at ..." option in the Options panel where the user could specify the number of characters (or pixels?). 

* Query local database in the Internet DB popup menu or something

* Use WinINet functions!

* Option to mute system sounds when disc is playing. 

* If Notify CD can include the function of controlling CD volume, it'll be
  excellent! auxSetVolume...

* Perhaps one should add a -PLAYORPAUSE so you can toggle 
  it. -PAUSE which toggles in normal cases, doesnt work so well at 
  first instance.

* Multidisc play (Random etc)
